//! A spring as the solver uses it: three numbers that turn a rigid
//! constraint's impulse into a spring's.
//!
//! **Why every constraint is a little bit of a spring.** A solver that
//! takes back drift by asking for a fixed fraction of it as a velocity -
//! Baumgarte's way - puts the correction into the bodies as real speed.
//! When the solver converges that is harmless. When it does not - a heavy
//! crate on a light bridge, a wrecking ball on a chain - each correction
//! overshoots a little, the next is fed from the overshoot, and the
//! structure gains energy until it flies apart. A spring, stepped
//! implicitly, cannot add energy however stiff it is set: its damping is
//! built into how it is solved. So contacts and joints take back drift the
//! way a very stiff, heavily damped spring would, and a stiff enough spring
//! is rigid to the eye.
//!
//! This is Erin Catto's "soft step" ("Solver2D", 2024). The
//! arithmetic is the implicit Euler step of a damped spring of `hertz` and
//! `damping_ratio`, rearranged so that the spring's stiffness and damping
//! never appear on their own and cannot be too big for the step:
//!
//! ```text
//! impulse = -mass_scale * m * (cdot + bias_rate * C) - impulse_scale * total
//! ```
//!
//! for a constraint of effective mass `m`, speed `cdot`, error `C` and
//! accumulated impulse `total`. Given in hertz and not in newtons per
//! metre, because a frequency means the same for a crate as for a car.
